## Completed Items
- I adjusted the game resolution and font sizes
- Created a basic "game hud" for showing "count of friends saved" and "distance traveled" while the game runs (still need to connect this to actual variables)
- I created some placeholder art for the cliff sides and the player character
- Set up an initial player script for left-to-right movement
- Watched a video on how to make the background endlessly scroll
