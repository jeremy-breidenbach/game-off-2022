## Completed Items
- I sketched some game concept ideas onto graph paper and showed my kids and they are on board with the idea:
  - The game will be a variation of an "endless runner," the theme will be "If all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you jump too?" (the cliche phrase was my wife's idea)
  - Instead of a "runner" the game will be an "endless faller" where your character jumps off a cliff and endlessly falls, meanwhile you try to save your friends who are also falling.
- I set up the Godot project to be in portrait mode after some quick research on portrait gaming on mobile devices and iPad resolutions (I am hoping to set the resolution to iPad 7th-9th gen so that I can export the game to iOS and my kids can demo it on their iPads)
- Set up buttons and fonts for the game
