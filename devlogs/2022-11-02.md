First day of development. 

The game jam started yesterday afternoon (Nov 1) but I got a late start deciding to participate in the jam with my kids.

## Completed Items
- I discussed the jam with my kids and did some initial discussion regarding the theme (cliche) and some game ideas
- I created a Godot project for the game and set up initial Title, Credits, and Instructions screens with a scene transition
- I created a GitHub repo for the project

## Planned for Tomorrow
- Review "cliches" and brainstorm game ideas
- Add fonts to Godot project
- Choose color palette
